                    If someone asked me how I characterize myself, I would say a determined self-starter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although this is a common phrase, it is not just a phrase to me. In my case, I know my heritage,
                    and I set a plank for myself very high. I'll talk about that later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in Minsk, Belarus, in a very educated family. Both of my parents hold Ph.D. in
                    engineering.
                    My mom is in electrical engineering, and my dad is in optical engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up, I never liked kindergarten. I'd always prefer to stay at home and read all day versus
                    playing with my peers.
                    In 2005 my sisters were born, and I started playing tennis and swimming.
                    In 2006, I was the first-grader at Gymnasium No. 22 in Minsk, Belarus.
                    That year was also a big hit for my family's wealth for political reasons that changed some of my
                    life perspectives.
                    I stopped playing tennis for three years, swimming was almost free, so I kept going at it. In 2009 I
                    was back on the tennis court; however, we couldn't afford much tennis,
                    so many initiatives came from me. In the meantime, I was good at math.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being an active kid, sometimes it was challenging to pay attention to the details. In 4th grade, I
                    learned the lesson when I
                    confused addition and subtraction in an easy equation in the regional math competition and was 3rd
                    instead of 1st
                </p>
                <p>
                    2010 was a wild year when I had late-stage pneumonia and was hospitalized just in time for it not to
                    do any permanent damage to my lungs. The same year I was diagnosed with PFO.
                    I was not allowed to swim and was almost banned from tennis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Somehow we managed to stay in, and that was when I truly understood what gratitude means. The
                    following year, my grandpa's brother published a book about heritage.
                    He has dedicated the previous seven years of his life to research, and that 400-page book was quite
                    impressive. In this book, I found out that one of my ancestors was The Colonel
                    of Grand Dutchy of Lithuania, Stanislav Arciszewski (my mom's last name). No doubt, he wanted his
                    successors to achieve something.
                    I think that discovering this fact set high standards for my work and everything I do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward through years of struggling and almost quitting tennis due to financial reasons. Now we
                    were in 2016, Alex is a solid tennis player ranked internationally.
                    In the meantime, I managed to score 8th place in the country in the mathematical competition in
                    2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long story short, financials and other reasons make it clear that professional tennis is far and
                    unreachable. However, tennis scholarship in the United States is real and does not seem bad.
                    I started looking for colleges late, and my choice was Cornerstone University in Grand Rapids, MI
                    which I don't regret.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was God's plan. CU Coach Zac answered the same day I got my exam results. My undergraduate years
                    at Cornerstone were full of figuring out
                    American culture, lots of work to pay bills, and finding out what I wanted to do with my life while
                    leading the CU men's tennis team to its best conference results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were many options, and after working full-time in a freight brokerage, I figured out what I
                    did not want to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought a lot about what I am good at, and I figured that analytics is my field. I do like
                    researching things and making data-driven decisions on my own.
                    This is how my company UrMove got started. After working in the moving industry, researching the
                    market, and identifying a clear opportunity for a p2p platform.
                    Now, we are a team of 8 people, including four original founders, dedicated to making moving easy
                    for people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the meantime, I understand that start-up is not everything, and in my 20ies, I need to explore
                    other things. These days, I'm busy teaching tennis and developing
                    my coding skills while looking for a full-time analyst role, preferably in the finance field.
