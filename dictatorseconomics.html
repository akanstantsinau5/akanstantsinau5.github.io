                <p>Can a strong leader be good for a country's economy? Let's to take a look at data.
                    There are so many factors that must be taken into an account, and to be fair,
                    this is a topic that needs deep research of every country that had a dictator
                    with lots of data to talk about consequences and draw the best conclusion.
                    However, it is not my doctorate and I will be looking at simple factors like average GDP growth,
                    inflation rate, income, etc. in order to try to answer the following question,
                    is there any correlation between years ruled and the economic condition of the country?
                </p>
                <p>According to the different sources, there are fifty current dictators in the world.
                    Nineteen in Africa, twelve in the Middle East, eight in Asia, seven in Euroasia, and one in Europe.
                    To make sure that I eliminate options where possibly current dictators' decisions haven't kicked in
                    yet
                    I will only work with available data from the countries that had one same leader for over the past
                    fifteen years,
                    starting the following year after the ruler came to the authority. This reduces the list to the
                    following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cameroon, leader Paul Biya since 30 June 1975</li>
                    <li>Equatorial Guinea, leader Teodoro Mbasogo since 3 August 1979</li>
                    <li>Iran, leader Ali Khamenei since 13 October 1981</li>
                    <li>Cambodia, leader Hun Sen since 26 December 1984</li>
                    <li>Uganda, leader Yoweri Museveni since 26 January 1986</li>
                    <li>Kazakhstan, leader Nursultan Nazarbayev since 16 December 1991</li>
                    <li>Tajikistan, leader Emomali Rahmon since 19 November 1992</li>
                    <li>Belarus, leader Alexander Lukashenko since 20 July 1994</li>
                    <li>Rwanda, leader Paul Kagame since 22 April 2000</li>
                    <li>Russia, leader Vladimir Putin since 8 May 2000</li>
                    <li>Turkey, leader Recep Erdogan since 14 March 2003</li>
                    <li>Azerbaijan, leader Ilham Aliyev since 4 August 2003</li>
                    <li>Uzbekistan, leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev since 12 December 2003</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This list may seem incomplete because we don't have some obvious dictatorships like North Korea or
                    Venezuela.
                    This is the case for the following reasons: North Korea data is not available just like
                    Djibouti, Eritrea, and Syria (which are not on the list as well)
                    and Nicolas Maduro had been in the office only since 2013 which does not fit 15 years criteria.
                </p>After collecting the data using <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">Worldbank data</a>
                and <a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/ranking">Heritage Foundation data</a> I had to clean it.
                This is what it looked like before putting it in R.
                <div><img src="images/dictatorscleandata.png" class="image fit" /></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>YRRLD - YTD Length of term</li>
                    <li>AAGGDP - Average Annual GDP Growth during the term</li>
                    <li>AAIR - Average Annual Inflation Rate during the term</li>
                    <li>AAFI - Average Annual Foreign Investment</li>
                    <li>ATGDPP - Average Trade GDP Percentage</li>
                    <li>AGDPPC - Average GDP Per Capita</li>
                    <li>AGNIPC - Average GNI Per Capita</li>
                    <li>FIO - Freedom Index Overall According to Heritage.org, out of 100</li>
                    <li>BF - Business Freedom</li>
                    <li>TF - Trade Freedom</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now it is a good time to upload it to R and see results. I'll be using linear regression
                    to check different paramenters and see if there is any statistically significant correlation.
                </p>
                <p>13 countries, 13 a little different but mostly similar stories. Every single country with a strong
                    leader is beating the EU, USA,
                    and world average in terms of average GDP growth and has a higher inflation rate. Also, every single
                    country except for Russia on the
                    list has a negative average annual foreign direct investment which means investors are leaving over
                    time. 6 countries are losing on
                    average over a billion in foreign investments year over a year.
                </p>
                <p>According to the quick snapshots, I find it intriguing that countries that do trade with China tend
                    to be less free in terms of
                    economics and more corrupt. For instance, Azerbaijan, the highest-ranked country on the Economic
                    Freedom List (ranked 38) out of our list does not
                    have China in the main trade partner list while Iran, the lowest-ranked country on the list (ranked
                    168) does 48% of exports to China and 28% of imports from China
                    (the highest percentage in the list).
                </p>
                <div><img src="images/dictatorsresults.png" class="image float left" width="400" height="250" /></div>
                <p>Now, more important results are necessary for answering the question, what does the length of the
                    term affect.
                    According to R, we can see a clear correlation between years ruled, inflation rate, freedom index,
                    business freedom, and trade freedom.
                    With an R squared score of .8532, we can conclude that one year of dictatorship means -0.7 in
                    Freedom Index, -0.23 in Business Freedom,
                    -0.58 in Trade Freedom, and every 10 years of having a strong leader would result in having around
                    18.69% of inflation per year!
